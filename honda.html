								<h2> Abstract</h2>
							</header>
								<p>The Honda team worked together to create a tilting table. So, the Honda workers could slide the car doors onto the table and check for any imperfections. The table can then tilt downwards to slide the car door to the carts.</p>

							<header>
							<h2> Problem Statement</h2>
							</header>	
							<p>Determine the best method to eliminate the manual lifting of front and rear doors to perform quality checks.</p>

								<h3>Ideas</h3>
								<u1 class="alt">
									<li>A simple exoskeleton back support with arm pieces that are mechanically powered by gears and belts to reduce and distribute the weight of the doors evenly in the lifting process.</li>
									<li>A crane type machine that works via hydraulics or air that picks the door straight up from the top of the window frame and transfers it to the table.</li>
									<li>A mechanical lift that has clamps that fit in between the doors and expands in the holes on the inside of the door to lift it to table height.</li>
									<li>Getting rid of the table and mounting a mechanical arm to the floor that can reach over and pick up the door and hold it still enough to do the inspection with the door suspended.</li>
									<li>A rolling and collapsable mechanical arm that grabs the inside of the door then picks it up, tilts it flat and then can be maneuvered to set sets it on the table.</li>
									<li>Removing the table and placing a mechanical arm that has a magnet attached to the end of the arm that can attach to the inside side of the door and hold the door in place while the inspection is performed.</li>

								<h2>Preliminary Design</h2>
							</header>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pdper.png" width="100" height="100"/></span>Assumptions: door weight 35lb, magnet weight 1.3 lb, magnet dimensions ‎‎‎3.4 x 2.8 x 1.8 inches, pull force 800N, max length of the arm extended 8.11 ft, need door dimensions, A moment is defined as the length times the weight. With this formula we found that the base needs to be able to withstand a moment force of 283.85 LBF. The arms should not be extended to this length so if we design the base to withstand this force then the door should be able to handle the force that we will be putting on it. We have also added a safety bar with a hook to attach to the door in case the magnet fails.</p>

								<h2>Final Design</h2>
							</header>
								<p>Our design has greatly changed from the brainstorming phase. The original design had a pneumatic arm that would reach out and grab the door for testing. The new design involves a tilting table. There have been multiple revisions with this design involving the type of material it would be manufactured with, different gear designs and how the gear attaches to the table, multiple motor configuration designs, how the rod attaches to the table. Due to the original idea being completely changed, the schedule, cost, and responsibilities for the project had to be greatly changed. We had some difficulty finding a replacement motor that met our specifications after it was determined that we would be unable to buy the original motor that we intended, which created a significant delay. The overall cost of the project decreased dramatically with our completely new design.</p>
